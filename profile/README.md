## What is itshover?

**itshover** is an open-source library of animated React icons. Unlike traditional icon sets where animation is bolted on later, these icons are designed from the ground up with motion in mind.

![Features Overview](images/2.png)

Each icon is an editable React component that works with Next.js, shadcn/ui, and modern design systems.

## Why this exists

![Motion First Design](images/3.png)

Most icon libraries add animation as an afterthought. We flipped that around—every icon here is built with its animation as a core part of the design. The result is icons that feel intentional and alive without being distracting.

**What you get:**
- Open source React components you can edit
- Animations that actually make sense for each icon
- Copy-paste ready code for Next.js and React projects
- Works with shadcn/ui and Tailwind out of the box
